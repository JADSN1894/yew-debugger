I'm excited to introduce `yew-debugger` ‚Äì a powerful DevTools extension meticulously designed to enhance your debugging experience with Yew framework applications. Dive deep into your code, diagnose issues, and streamline your development process with ease.

## üí™ Motivation

The concept of "making the debug first" in game development is a software development approach that emphasizes creating and implementing debugging tools and systems early in the development process. This approach is also sometimes referred to as "debug-driven development".

The idea behind it is to prioritize the ability to identify and fix issues in the game code as early as possible, which can lead to more efficient development and higher-quality games. Here are some reasons why this approach can be beneficial:

1. **Early Issue Identification**: By focusing on debugging tools and systems from the start, game developers can quickly identify and address bugs and issues as they arise, reducing the likelihood of major problems accumulating later in development.
1. **Improved Productivity**: Having effective debugging tools in place can streamline the development process, as developers can spend less time searching for the causes of problems and more time implementing and testing new features.
1. **Quality Assurance**: A strong focus on debugging early in development can help ensure that the game is more stable and reliable, which is crucial for quality assurance and testing.
1. **Reduced Stress**: Addressing issues as they arise can reduce the stress and pressure that often accompanies late-stage bug fixing, especially as release deadlines approach.

## üîß Key features:

1. Detailed inspection of Yew components.
1. Real-time monitoring of application state.
1. Seamless integration with the development environment.
